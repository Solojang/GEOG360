## Objective:
### We present methods to summarize temporal difference in a time series of land categories
- To develop methods that can summarize critical temporal differences of land categories from time-series land cover maps.
- To create maps and graphs that are both innovative and able to effectively communicate important information that are helpful to our intended audiences beyond this semester, including the MapBiomas team, and potentially, remote sensing specialists and land change scientists. 

## Maps and graphs:
### Our maps and graphs are developed to answer the following questions:
- Throughout the time series, what is the most frequently appearing land category in each location?
- What is the area of each land category at each time point?
- How much did each land category lost and gained during each time interval?
- A particular category lost to and gained from which other categories?
- A particular category lost to and gained from which other categories?
- What is the amount of change over various time steps?
